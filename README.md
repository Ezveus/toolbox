# Before you keep reading

This readme file is only for the eyes of the Ruby On Rails teams at moduloTech.

There are plans to update it to the rest of the world in a few weeks

# Introduction

Standardizing our development process and habits is part of our startegy to embrace a pleasant journey as any developper belonging to moduloTech should be able to think and write code in the exact same way as another one.

This Handbook has been written and updated by all the developers of moduloTech, feel free to submit your own pull request and keep this page **beautiful** and **uptodate**

## What

Any issue that you work on should be handled in a **feature branch** with the following name format `#{issue-id} short description`.

**feature branches** are very useful and efficient in the following scenarios:
  * It greatly helps the reviewer to understand what the PR's topic is
  * If the reviewer has comments awaiting for your response, you will only slow down the release of this particular feature instead of your whole work
  * Cherry picking is now super easy too
  * You can be much more picky when taking your **feature screenshots** (see below)

## Feature screenshots

Beauty is at the core of our apps and philosophy, therefore, everytime you update a view or anything that is visible by the end-user, you **have to** include a screenshot (or video) of your changes in the MR (not the issue).
